Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of projects I have worked on, covering areas like Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Vision. Each project reflects my hands-on experience and the application of advanced techniques to solve real-world problems.

I‚Äôm a Computer Science graduate with a 3.53 GPA from Brawijaya University. I‚Äôve sharpened my data science skills through the Bangkit Academy‚Äôs Machine Learning bootcamp, where I dived deep into advanced machine learning techniques. During my internship, I put this knowledge into action by implementing OpenAI‚Äôs language models to create a chatbot. Moreover, I can perform oral and written language capability both in Indonesian and English.

# üß† Machine Learning

- **Customer's Purchase Probability Based On E-Commerce Clickstream Data**  
  *After an exploration, I've decided to predict the probability of a customer making a purchase using clickstream data from an e-commerce platform using Deep Learning methods. There's 2 notebooks for this project, the [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/2-e-commerce-c-t-feature-engineering.ipynb) notebook and [Prediction](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/3-data-analysis-purchase-probability.ipynb) notebook.*

- **Fraud Detection on Crypto Coin (Ethereum)**  
  *Using an open database about Ethereum (ETH) transaction information, my goal is to build a model to detect fraudulent activities in Ethereum transactions, enhancing the security of crypto assets. You can see the presentation [Here](https://www.can.com/design/DAGM_b1oWIE/K5pZiW0LdGxT0zixp3BNhw/edit).*

- **Customer Segmentation Based On E-Commerce Database**  
  *Utilizing clustering techniques to segment customers by buying patterns and also spending profiles, enabling targeted marketing/sales strategies in e-commerce, especially to retain a specific segment of customers. You can see the presentation [Here](https://www.can.com/design/DAGM_W_NStk/uhiPI0UiJDpaGBdjF1chwQ/edit).*

- **Rain Prediction for Farmer's Decision Making**  
  *Developing a model to predict rainfall, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop management. You can see the presentation [Here](https://www.can.com/design/DAGM_N-1KWs/nH4DgxUGZ8JNOJsMfHvbxQ/edit) and the notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/rain_pred.ipynb).*
  
- **Plant Disease and Soil Detection (Terrafarms's Bangkit Academy Project)**  
  *Providing farmers with the tools and technologies they need to achieve higher yields, improve efficiency, and promote sustainability. This plant and soil detection was a small part of my big project [Terrafarms](https://github.com/Terrafarms). You can see the specific machine learning implementation [Here](https://github.com/Terrafarms/bangkit-machine-learning).* 

- **K-Nearest Neighbor in Kinematic Robot**  
  *Applying the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to improve the accuracy of robot kinematics in a controlled environment. You can see the repository [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/arm-robot-kinematic-syaugi).*  

## üìä Data Analysis

- **Terrorism & Poverty Relation Analysis**  
  *Exploring the relationship between terrorism and poverty through a comprehensive data analysis approach using R. Providing an "aha moment" from two databases that correlate with each other. You can see the R notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/terrorism_poverty.Rmd).*

- **E-Commerce Clickstream Data Analysis**  
  *Analyzing e-commerce clickstream data to uncover user behavior patterns to achieve insight for further analysis. The main idea of this was to explore the data. You can see the notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/1-e-commerce-c-t-data-exploration.ipynb).*
