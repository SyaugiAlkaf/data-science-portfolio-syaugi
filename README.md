# Introduction
Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of projects I have worked on, covering areas like Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning, and Computer Vision. Each project reflects my hands-on experience and the application of advanced techniques to solve real-world problems.

I’m a Computer Science graduate with a 3.53 GPA from Brawijaya University. I’ve sharpened my data science skills through the Bangkit Academy’s Machine Learning bootcamp, where I dived deep into advanced machine learning techniques. During my internship, I put this knowledge into action by implementing OpenAI’s language models to create a chatbot. Moreover, i can perform oral and written language capability both in indonesia and english.

# Data Science Projects

## Machine Learning

- **Customer's Purchase Probability Based On E-Commerce Clickstream Data**  
  *After an exploration, i've decided to predict probability of a customer making a purchase using clickstream data from an e-commerce platform using Deep Learning method. There's 2 notebook for this project, the [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/2-e-commerce-c-t-feature-engineering.ipynb) notebook and [Prediction](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/3-data-analysis-purchase-probability.ipynb) notebook. *

- **Fraud Detection on Crypto Coin (Ethereum)**  
  *Using an Open database about Etherium (ETH) transaction information, my goal is  to build a model to detect fraudulent activities in Ethereum transactions, enhancing the security of crypto assets. you can see the presentation [Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGM_b1oWIE/K5pZiW0LdGxT0zixp3BNhw/edit).*

- **Customer Segmentation Based On E-Commerce Database**  
  *Utilizing clustering techniques to segment customers by buying patterns and also spending profile, enabling targeted marketing/sales strategies in e-commerce, specially to retain a specific segment of customers. You can see the presentation [Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGM_W_NStk/uhiPI0UiJDpaGBdjF1chwQ/edit).*

- **Rain Prediction for Farmer's Decision Making**  
  *Developing a model to predict rainfall, helping farmers make informed decisions about crop management. You can see the presentation [Here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGM_N-1KWs/nH4DgxUGZ8JNOJsMfHvbxQ/edit) and the notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/rain_pred.ipynb)*
  
- **Plant Disease and Soil Detection (Terrafarms's Bangkit Academy Project)**  
  *Provide farmers with the tools and technologies they need to achieve higher yields, improve efficiency, and promote sustainability. This plant and soil detection was a small part of my big project [Terrafarms](https://github.com/Terrafarms). You can see the specific machine learning implementation [Here](https://github.com/Terrafarms/bangkit-machine-learning).* 

- **K-Nearest Neighbor in Kinematic Robot**  
  *Applying the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to improve the accuracy of robot kinematics in a controlled environment. You can see the repository [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/arm-robot-kinematic-syaugi)*  
  
## Data Analysis

- **Terrorism & Poverty Relation Analysis**  
  *Exploring the relationship between terrorism and poverty through a comprehensive data analysis approach using R. Providing an aha moment from to database that corelate eachother. You can see the R notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/terrorism_poverty.Rmd).*

- **E-Commerce Clickstream Data Analysis**  
  *Analyzing e-commerce clickstream data to uncover user behavior patterns to achive insight for further analysis. The main idea of this was to explore the data. You can see the notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/1-e-commerce-c-t-data-exploration.ipynb).* 

## LLM (Large Language Model)

- **Database/Tabular Data Analysis Using LIDA**  
  *Leveraging Large Language Models to perform in-depth analysis of database and tabular data, automating complex queries, giving goals posibility, also providing a small visualizations. You can see the notebook [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/data-science-portfolio-syaugi/blob/main/lida_tutorial.ipynb).*  

- **Micro Chatbot Using OpenAI API**  
  *Creating a simple chatbot utilizing OpenAI's API, capable of handling basic customer inquiries and interactions. You can see it in [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/syaugi-portfolio/tree/main/chatbot).* 

## Reinforcement Learning

- **DQN Implementation with Space Invaders Game**  
  *Implementing Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to train an agent for playing the Space Invaders game, focusing on reinforcement learning techniques. The project available to play in my [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/saugi/dqn-SpaceInvadersNoFrameskip-v4) repo.*

- **DQN Implementation with Super Mario Game**  
  *Using DQN to create an AI that plays the Super Mario game, showcasing advanced reinforcement learning capabilities. You can see the project in [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/supermario-syaugi).*

## Computer Vision

- **Plate Detection**  
  *Developing a computer vision model to accurately detect and recognize license plates in images or video streams. You can see the project [Here](https://github.com/SyaugiAlkaf/platedetection-syaugi).*
